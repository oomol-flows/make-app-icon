# Block Builder - Create Anything with Simple Blocks

## What Are Blocks?

Blocks are like digital building bricks. Just like you can build a house with LEGO bricks, you can build apps, websites, and tools with blocks. Each block does one simple thing, and you connect them together to create something amazing.

## Why Blocks Make Life Easier

**No Coding Required**: You don't need to learn programming. If you can drag and drop, you can build.

**See What You're Building**: Blocks show you exactly what you're creating as you build it.

**Easy to Change**: Want to move something? Just drag it somewhere else. Made a mistake? Just delete the block.

**Mix and Match**: Use blocks made by other people, or create your own custom blocks.
